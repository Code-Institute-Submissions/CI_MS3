# The Donnybrook Cookbook Website

This is a recipe site intended for sharing recipes, with a focus on Irish cuisine
but other dishes being allowed as well. Anyone can view any of the recipes, but to
make full use of the site’s functionality making a user account is required. Users
can create, edit and delete their own recipes in addition to viewing ones uploaded
by others. Each recipe contains an ingredients list, instructions list, how long it
takes to prepare the dish and how many servings it contains. The recipes also
contain an image of the dish.

## Design

**Color Scheme**

The site primarily focuses on Irish cuisine, so a color scheme matching the colors of
the Irish flag was chosen. This is engaging and convenient, since the colors of the
flag are also generally suitable for a cooking-related site for their warmth.

**Typography**

The fonts used for the site are Bad Script and Noto Sans. The Bad script fallback 
font is cursive, and for Noto Sans the fallback is sans-serif. Bad Script is used
as the font for headings and other text that should be particularly eye-catching, 
and Noto Sans is used as the standard font for bulk content for its clarity.

**Imagery**

The site contains many images of dishes, in accordance with the purpose of the site
to showcase the recipes they represent.

## Features



**Features To Implement**

Ratings & Comments - It would be a helpful and nice feature if users could rate the recipes and comment on them.

Images - Ideally, image submission should happen through uploading the files themselves rather than entering a URL due potential issues with images hosted elsewhere.

More detailed userpages - The site is ‘communal’ in a way and it would be a beneficial feature if users could upload an image of themselves and perhaps an About section where they can write a bit about themselves and their particular interests related to cooking.

Following users - A feature to allow users to follow others and get notifications about recipes added.

A search functionality for keywords to help people find what they want once the collection size increased
