**Features To Implement**

Ratings & Comments - It would be a helpful and nice feature if users could rate the recipes and comment on them.

Images - Ideally, image submission should happen through uploading the files themselves rather than entering a URL due potential issues with images hosted elsewhere.

More detailed userpages - The site is ‘communal’ in a way and it would be a beneficial feature if users could upload an image of themselves and perhaps an About section where they can write a bit about themselves and their particular interests related to cooking.

Following users - A feature to allow users to follow others and get notifications about recipes added.

A search functionality for keywords to help people find what they want once the collection size increased
